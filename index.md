title: "WEST: Women Entering and Staying in Tech"
---

## What is WEST?

Our goal is to enable 1:1 mentorship for women in the early to middle stages of their technology careers. We believe that by providing more direct support, advocacy, and community development, we can help more women build rewarding careers in technology.

## Why are we doing this?

Women make tech better. But numbers show there's a lot of work to do. The U.S. Census Bureau found that women's representation in computer occupations has been on decline since the 1990's, while the number of open jobs in the field is expected to explode to 1.4 million in 2020. We hope that this program will help more women enter and flourish in these increasingly important and necessary technical roles.

## How will it work?

We will kick off a pilot of this program in early 2015.
Women in technical roles from Facebook, Box, and Pinterest will serve as 1:1 mentors to a class of women in the early to middle-stages of their careers.

The program will incorporate 1:1 and group interactions over the course of a year.

WEST will be open to mentees in the Bay Area, from those beginning their careers as interns to mid-career women looking to further their growth or take the next step. We hope to expand to more career levels and geographic regions in the future.

## Who is eligible?

This pilot will be open to early through mid-career women from the Bay Area in technical roles like Engineering, Operations, Product, Design, and Web Development.

## How can I apply?

More details to come on the application process and timing to come. If you'd like to get involved and be notified when applications for the 2015 WEST program opens, please email us at hello@westmentors.org
