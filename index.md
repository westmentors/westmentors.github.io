## What is WEST?
WEST is a mentorship program for women in technology.

WEST (Women Entering and Staying in Tech) is designed to enable 1:1 mentorship for women in the early- to middle-stages of their technology careers. We believe that by providing more direct support, advocacy, and community development, we can help more women build rewarding careers in technology.

## Why are we doing this?
Women make tech better. But numbers show there's a lot of work to do. The need for technical roles continues to grow and is expected to reach 1.4 million in 2020, yet the U.S. Census Bureau found that women's representation in computer occupation has declined since the 1990's.

It is our hope that this program will help more women enter and flourish in these increasingly important and necessary technical roles.

## How will it work?
We will kick off a pilot of this program in early 2015.

Women in technical roles from Facebook, Box, and Pinterest will serve as 1:1 mentors to a class of women in the early to middle-stages of their careers.

The program will incorporate 1:1 and group interactions, in person and online, over the course of a year.

WEST will be open to mentees in the Bay Area, from those beginning their careers as interns to mid-career women looking to further their growth or take the next step. We hope to expand to more career levels and geographic regions in the future.
